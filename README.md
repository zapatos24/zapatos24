### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Jeremy (he/him)! Iâ€™m a Data Scientist on a mission to make our society more equitable, showing leaders how to make data driven decisions in moving our country forward. My most recent work has involved publicly distributed mapping visualizations and performance tracking for recruitment in campaign operations, from data manipulation through dashboard construction. I also built a machine learning model to predict how senators would vote on a given bill, you can check it out [here](senator-prediction.jeremytraberowens.com).

#### Software and Programming
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Python Analysis (Numpy, Pandas)
* Python Machine Learning / Deep Learning / NLP (SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow)
* Python Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, requests)
* Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google DataStudio, Tableau)
* Git

#### Web
* Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, ECR, Sagemaker, Route53)

#### Database
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL


### My Data Science Projects:
An XGBoost model deployed on AWS that incorporates NLP to predict how senators would vote on a given bill. [View GitHub code](https://github.com/zapatos24/senator_nlp_vote_prediction) or [View the app](senator-prediction.jeremytraberowens.com).  
A data pipeline to manipulate records from VAN and create a dashboard to find new leads and track organizer performance [View GitHub code](https://github.com/zapatos24/va02_volunteer_book) or [View the Dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/86e40642-b278-411b-832c-d3ebdce69fef/page/kBxcB).
